## Background
The United Kingdom has implemented a national program to replace traditional energy meters with smart meters [1]. These meters offer more accurate information on energy usage and costs to both suppliers and households using them [1]. Consumers who have better transparency on their energy consumption along with live information on their energy spending can more accurately make decisions about how much electricity they would like to consume. This can reveal patterns like the price or income demands of elasticity. Additionally, a wide rollout of smart meters can give us a comparison between the various regions of the UK, revealing trends over space and time.

## Research Questions
Our project aims to...
1. Identify the daily peaks in energy usage.
2. Sequentially, determine where those peaks can be curbed with peak pricing.

## Approach and Coding
We coded by aggregating the data in various ways to view consumption trends. Our primary focus was visualizing who consumes the most and when.

We have limited our geographic display to the UK Power Network (UKPN) Distribution Network Operator (DNO) and its EPN license area of Bedford/Cambridge smart meters because of the greater data availability and general computing and storage limits. The data available is for the month of February 2024.

## Weaknesses and Difficulties
Some major weaknesses were in lack of data, especially as shown in the geo plots where there are gaps in substations. These are missing either because the EPN does not have smartmeters there or the population is too small to share the data for privacy reasons.

We addressed this by focusing on urban areas, where there is more data (although incomplete) and more consumers.

## Plots

Plot 1 shows the trends in consumption by time of day. The largest peak is in the evening hours.

Plot 2 shows a sample of our Shiny dashboard, which allows one to visualize consumption by time of day in the Bedford/Cambridge region.

Plot 3 shows average consumption by substation overall, indicating where might be the locations primarily affected by peak pricing.
